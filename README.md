- -5*n pts: Lose 5 points for every time you do not follow the instructions for the hand-in format

## Submission format

This is very important as you will lose 5 points for every time you do not follow the instructions. From your repository, do the following:

- Click Code > Download ZIP.
- Rename the file as `<your_gt_username>.zip`

## Important Notes

- Please follow the environment setup in [Project 0](https://github.gatech.edu/cs4476/project-0).
- Do **not** use absolute paths in your code or your code will break.
- Use relative paths like the starter code already does.
- Failure to follow any of these instructions will lead to point deductions. Create the zip file and hand it in with your report PDF through Gradescope (please remember to mark which parts of your report correspond to each part of the rubric).
